# Tracking DublinBus in RealTime using Apache Kafka, Leaflet and Flask.

Apache Kafka is the open-source stream-processing software platform developed by the Apache Software Foundation, written in Scala and Java.
Apache Kafka is based on the commit log, and it allows users to subscribe to it and publish the data to any number of systems or real time applications.
Monitoring end-to-end performance requires tracking metrics from brokers, consumers and producers, in addition to monitoring Zookeeper, which Kafka uses
for coordination among consumers.
